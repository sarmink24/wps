- for search form and results for section A Feature 1, make search fields and result table fields consistent.
- when returned results are zero, make sure you show that message in the table (react-table surely has support for this)
- change navbar code to make API call to get section names and features and render in a 2 level tree. We will hook them up to the main area later.
