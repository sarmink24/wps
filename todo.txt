- for search form and results for section A Feature 1, make search fields and result table fields consistent.
- when returned results are zero, make sure you show that message in the table (react-table surely has support for this)
- change navbar code to make API call to get section names and features and render in a 2 level tree. We will hook them up to the main area later.

- update create workflow to actually persist data in the backend, with the right field names.
- the search call for particular section/feature combination should search this persisted data and return the right results.

- For create. POST /api/section/{sectionId}/feature/{featureId} with body that has an object containing field name values, 
- so name = "abc", startDate="01/01/2020"
- For Search. GET /api/section ...very similar, but a GET call.
